### About this project
This is an old php project that i made in my 2nd year of college. 
Back at that time im still new to web programming and php so the UI might not look good and the features are also very limited.
The code isn't clean at all and folder structure is a mess too

### Features: 
+ As a client: 
    - Register/login account
    - Search for food by name
    - Display foods by categorie
    - Add food to cart and order
+ As an administrator
    - Can see all orders and total revenue
    - Can access to account/category/food management such as create,update,delete

### Cloning the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tuanloc288/php-food-service.git
```

### How to run
Run xampp then go to your localhost/phpmyadmin and import doanweb2.sql, this will do for the database
Then just run the index file on your browser (localhost/[yourfoldername]/index.php)
